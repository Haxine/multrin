Multrin is a cross-platform app built on top of  `Electron`, `React`, `styled-components` and `TypeScript`, that lets you to organize apps in tabs, by just dropping them onto Multrin. It aims to greatly improve your productivity and organization.

> NOTE: Multrin works currently only on Windows since it's dependent on `node-window-manager` which also only supports Windows. I'm working on macOS and Linux support.

# Components

Multrin has some very important components:

- Tabs from [Wexond](https://github.com/wexond/wexond)
- [`node-window-manager`](https://github.com/sentialx/node-window-manager) for managing the docked windows
- [`mouse-hooks`](https://github.com/sentialx/mouse-hooks) for listening to global mouse events, for example when dropping a window into Multrin.

# Running

Before running Multrin, please ensure you have [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine. You can use `npm`, although I highly recommend to use `yarn`. In this guide I will use `yarn`.

Also you will need build tools. To install them, please run:

```bash
$ npm install --global windows-build-tools
```

Firstly, run this command to install all needed dependencies. If you have encountered any problems, please report it. I will try to help as much as I can.

```bash
$ yarn
```

The given command below will run Multrin in the development mode.

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

## Other commands

You can also run other commands, for other tasks like building the app or linting the code, by using the commands described below.
